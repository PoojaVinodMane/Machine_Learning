- The task is to :
predict if an agricultural field is being used efficiently. A field can be classified as "high performing", "moderately performing" or "low performing". These labels measure if a field is achieving its potential given its resources, size and other qualities. For ex, a field classified as "low performing" may still produce a decent yield, but perhaps due to inefficiencies like distance from market, it is not maximizing its potential.
- The code make uses of Random forest classifier as an ensembler method for the VBN dataset.
- Preprocessing is done by handling missing values after standardizing the data.
- The F1 score is calculated at the end on the validation data.
